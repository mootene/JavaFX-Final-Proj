Thank you to everyone who joined us for 2023 Open Studios! We were thrilled to be able to welcome over 1,100 people into the School of Art buildings this year—a new record!—to meet with artists, see work, and attend our series of community-led events.

In addition to utilizing all five of our buildings on campus (36 + 32 Edgewood, 353 + 341 Crown, and 1156 Chapel), this was the first year that Open Studios included a satellite project through a Graphic Design pop-up at 1 Broadway. MFA students in Graphic Design created window installations, offered prints, and exhibited work in a new space that entirely reimagined what had formerly been a Patagonia store near the center of downtown New Haven.

Open Studios events included:
	•	Studio walkthroughs with Victoria Martinez, Painting/Printmaking MFA ‘20 and Climate Engagement Fellow for the Art in Cities Initiative, in her studio in Osborn Memorial Laboratories;
	•	a Pierogi Cart staged by Claire Hungerford, Graphic Design MFA ‘24, and Baxter Koziol, Sculpture MFA ‘24;
	•	BENT, a performance by Gabriela Rassi, Painting/Printmaking MFA ‘23, accompanied by William Bartholomew and Ziggy Coffey;
	•	a talk by Christopher Pullman, Senior Critic in Graphic Design, who screened a series of short motion design videos from recent MFA students in the Graphic Design Prelim program;
	•	a "Collaborative Community Canvas" staged by Lindsey Mancini, Assistant Director of Communications, in the Crown Street Courtyard that invited everyone to contribute to collective drawings on paper and canvas;
	•	and the Video Room, an all-weekend screening of short experimental films by MFA students from all departments.
